### Overview:

- Written and programmed in R.
- Natural language processing and tokenization.
- Creating an application using R's shinyapps.

### Background:

The aim of this project was to create an application that allows use of a predictive text model. This was achieved through analysis of text data and natural language processing. In this process, tokenization was used to create datasets of 'n-gram' word combinations. With this, I tried various methods that looked at ultimately finding the best efficiency of the final product. That is to say, increasing the 'n' in 'n-grams' to have word combinations of, say, 8 words, would absolutely improve the accuracy of a word prediction model but the code would most likely not run in a reasonable timeframe on most computers. Also, the speed of the final product output from the app's user's perspective must be considered in this efficiency.
